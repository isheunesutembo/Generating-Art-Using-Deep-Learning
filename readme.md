# Generating Art Using Deep Learning (Neural Style Transfer)

<p>Deep learning is the field responsible for self driving cars and facial recognition systems like FaceID on apple devices. In this repo we use deep learning to generate artistic images. A deep convnet is given a content image and a style image and it merges the two preserving content features such as head ,eyes and ears if the content image is a dog image , and preserve the style texture.The style image is usually paintings or ancient art drawings </p>
